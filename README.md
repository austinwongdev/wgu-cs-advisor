# Career Advisor Chatbot


## Description
This chatbot advises students at Western Governors University on career choices by asking them about their strengths, then recommending careers based on those strengths. It helps students identify their strengths by asking them questions about their strengths, such as “Are you good at data analysis?” In this example, if the student answers “Yes”, then the chatbot recommends data analyst as a potential career. Whether the student confirms or denies that the skill is a strength, the chatbot continues onto the next skill until it has asked the student about all skills and given recommendations based on the student’s responses.

Additionally, the files can be imported from this repository after creating a PandoraBots account and navigating to the Code Editor for a new bot.


## Future Improvements
* Refine the chatbot's responses to provide clearer responses to students’ questions
* Add more input variations (“Yes”, “Yeah”, “Y”, “Sure”) to make it simpler for students to communicate with the chatbot and improve the user experience
* Update questions and responses to reflect changes in WGU’s curriculum, in-demand job skills, and available jobs
* Increase number of careers to recommend
* Increase number of skills to ask about
* Add clarifying questions when students are unsure if they possess a skill or not
